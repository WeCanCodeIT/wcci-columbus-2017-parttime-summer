## Informational Interviews

There are several benefits to adding informational interviewing to your strategy for transitioning into a new career.

One of the benefits to consider is gaining insight from those currently working in the job roles you're interested, which can help you better decide if that's the road you want to take.

Another benefit is getting insight into your bucket lists companies. This can help you nail down whether this should still be a bucket list company for you, as well as help you better understand how to position yourself for that company.

The last benefit we are going to focus on is the benefit of beginning to build your network through building organic relationships with those who could then give you a lift into a job role when it arises or connect you to the right people who could.

### How to Get an Informational Interview
- [ ] Keep the message short (letting them know you're looking for help early in the message)
- [ ] Be clear about why you are reaching out (Why did you reach out to them in particular?)
- [ ] Be clear about who you are (Consider things you have in common)
- [ ] Be specific and flexible in your ask (BE CONSIDERATE OF TIME)
- [ ] Consider the subject line (i.e. "Saw your article on LinkedIn, would love to connect")

Things to Avoid:
- Poor word choice (i.e. "Pick your brain"), [grammar and spelling](https://www.grammarly.com/) mistakes
- Canceling and/or rescheduling the interview once offered
- Bombarding the entire office because they do talk
- Forgetting to send a follow-up thank you for any response and/or interview
- Attaching your resume, this is supposed to be a more casual and comfortable conversation
- Not responding promptly and appropriately (casual and comfortable does not mean unprofessional)

### What to Discuss in an Informational Interview
So you've landed the informational interview, but what are you going to talk about? Before the interview consider your goals and write out information you could possibly get from this interview that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get. This is your chance to get an authentic inside look into the organization and the job role.

**Sample Questions to Ask**

Get Started: Let them talk about themselves
- How did you get your start in this field?
- What’s it like working at your company?
- What projects are you working on right now?
- What’s your opinion on [exciting development in the industry]?

Get What You Came For
- How did you choose this company or position over others in your field?
- What is the most rewarding thing about working in this industry? The most challenging?
- My background is in urban planning—how do you think I can best leverage my previous experience for this field?
- I’m waiting to hear back about interviews for positions—what advice would you give me about how to best prepare?
- What experiences, skills, or personality traits does your company look for in new hires?
- What do you wish you had done differently when you first started at your company?

The Strong Finish
- Ask for recommendations for 2 or 3 more people who would be good to talk to as you continue networking
- Be specific in your request because it'll make it easier for your contact to think of someone
- Allow the contact to come up with anyone he/she feels would be a good next step for you
  - "Is there anyone else you would recommend that I speak with?"

### With Who to Get an Informational Interview
- [ ] Use your interview bucket list as a starting point for choosing who to ask for an informational interview
- [ ] Explore the job titles/roles at the company and make a list so you know what to search on LinkedIn
- [ ] Choose people who are in an aspirational role, but not so high up on the ladder that they may not have time for you
- [ ] Try to find someone you have common ground with, such as same alma mater, same sorority/fraternity, mutual connections, etc.)

### Homework
- [ ] Find 2 people at each of your bucket list companies to request an informational interview
- [ ] Draft a message for each and get feedback from at least 1 teammate from your cohort
- [ ] After receiving feedback and proof-reading one last time yourself, send your messages
