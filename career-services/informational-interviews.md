## Informational Interviews

There are several benefits to adding informational interviewing to your strategy for transitioning into a new career.

One of the benefits to consider is gaining insight from those currently working in the job roles you're interested, which can help you better decide if that's the road you want to take.

Another benefit is getting insight into your bucket lists companies. This can help you nail down whether this should still be a bucket list company for you, as well as help you better understand how to position yourself for that company.

The last benefit we are going to focus on is the benefit of beginning to build your network through building organic relationships with those who could then give you a lift into a job role when it arises or connect you to the right people who could.
