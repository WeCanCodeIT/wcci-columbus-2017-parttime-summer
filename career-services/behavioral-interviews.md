## Behavioral Interviews
Behavioral interviews are centered around questions, such as "Tell me about a time when..." or "Can you give me an example of..." as a means for the interviewer to get a sense of the way you've handled situations in the past to better gauge how you may handle them while working at their company. Some questions may not follow the same format to hint to you that they are behavioral, but a good way to look at it is if the interviewer is asking about something you "did", use the behavioral approach. This is a great opportunity, again, to talk about your past accomplishments.

### How to Answer Behavioral Questions
**Step 1:** Describe the situation.

**Step 2:** Describe the action you took.

**Step 3:** Describe the result of your action.

### Tips for Answering
- Be specific about the facts of the situation.
- Keep to the main points.
- Focus on what YOU did, not your team.
- The situation and result should be succinct, and put the emphasis on the action you took.

- Give me an example of a time that you felt you went above and beyond the call of duty at work. 
- Can you describe a time when your work was criticized?

### Homework
Create a chart like the one below where you will fill it in with S.A.R. structured stories for each category for each job and project you have listed on your resume. Design this well so it can be used as a study guide tool for you during phone interviews and for prepping for in person interviews.
