# Now we're cooking!

## Project Setup

1. Create a Java Project in Eclipse. (I'm using `cooking` as its name in my examples.)
1. Add the JUnit library to your project.
1. Create a new source folder called `test`.
  - Right click on your project name (`cooking` in my case), then `New->Source Folder`.
  - Specify `test` for `Folder name:`.
  - Click `Finish`.
1. Create a `cooking` package in your test folder.
  - Right click on the test folder.
  - Select `New->Package`.
  - Specify `cooking` for `Name:`.
  - Click `OK`.

## Adding Tests

You will find the tests [here](./test/cooking). You'll want to copy/paste each of them into the `cooking` package of your `test` source folder. You may find the `Raw` button at the upper right in GitHub helpful.

I'm using strange names for classes and tests here to express the order in which you should complete them. Also, the tests will seem a bit odd. Some of them are more simple than you'd expect; others may use unfamiliar code. Just work out how to make them pass!
